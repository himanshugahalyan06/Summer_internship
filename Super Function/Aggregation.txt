Great question! In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), **aggregation** and **inheritance** are both ways to establish relationships between classes, but they are fundamentally different in how they model those relationships.

### ‚úÖ **1. Inheritance** (IS-A relationship)

**Definition**:
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (**child or subclass**) inherits the properties and behavior (methods and attributes) of another class (**parent or superclass**).

**Example**:

```python
class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Some sound")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog IS-A Animal
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Bark")
```

Here, `Dog` inherits from `Animal`. This is an **IS-A** relationship:
‚úÖ A **Dog IS-A Animal**.

### ‚úÖ **2. Aggregation** (HAS-A relationship)

**Definition**:
Aggregation is a special form of association where one class contains a reference to another class. It models a **whole-part** relationship, but both can exist independently.

**Example**:

```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine):
        self.engine = engine  # Car HAS-A Engine

    def start_car(self):
        self.engine.start()
```

Here, `Car` has an `Engine`.
‚úÖ A **Car HAS-A Engine** (aggregation).
The `Engine` can exist independently of the `Car`.

### üîç Key Differences Between Inheritance and Aggregation

| Feature             | Inheritance                   | Aggregation                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Relationship Type   | IS-A                          | HAS-A                        |
| Purpose             | Code reuse, polymorphism      | Code modularity, flexibility |
| Coupling            | Tightly coupled               | Loosely coupled              |
| Lifetime dependency | Child often depends on parent | Parts can live independently |
| Example             | Dog IS-A Animal               | Car HAS-A Engine             |

### üß† When to Use What?

* Use **inheritance** when one class is a more specific version of another (e.g., `Bird` is a `Animal`).
* Use **aggregation** when one class is made up of or uses another (e.g., `Library` has `Books`).
