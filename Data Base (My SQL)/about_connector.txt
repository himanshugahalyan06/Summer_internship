Thanks for sharing the user and host info. You're right ‚Äî user `Himanshu` has host value `%`, which **means it's allowed to connect from any host**, but **this is only relevant inside MySQL, not for the Python code.**

### üîç Important Distinction:

* In **MySQL**, `%` means ‚Äúany host can connect using this user‚Äù (used in `GRANT`, `user@'%'`).
* In **Python code** (`mysql.connector.connect()`), you must specify the actual hostname or IP where the MySQL server is running.

### ‚úÖ So you should do the following:

If you are running the Python script on **the same machine** where MySQL is installed (which is most common), your connection code should be:

```python
mydb = mc.connect(
    host='localhost',     # Or use 127.0.0.1
    user='Himanshu',
    password='Himanshu2006'
)
```

---

### ‚úÖ If MySQL is on a **remote server**, use:

```python
mydb = mc.connect(
    host='192.168.x.x',  # IP address of the MySQL server
    user='Himanshu',
    password='Himanshu2006'
)
```

---

### ‚úÖ To verify if the user has permission to create a database:

Run this SQL in MySQL:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'Himanshu'@'%';
```

If it includes something like:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* ...
```

or

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON *.* ...
```

then you're good.
